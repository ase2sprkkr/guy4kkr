"""ASE Tk GUI subprocess with first-window readiness notification.

Tk is initialized on the *main thread of its own process*.  Running Tk on a
Python thread alongside Qt can crash the entire application in native GUI
libraries.  Unlike ASE's regular subprocess launcher, this entry point reports
when the top-level Tk window is mapped, not just when the process starts.

The structure is a plain ASE Atoms snapshot, transferred through stdin; there
is no temporary directory or intermediate trajectory file.
